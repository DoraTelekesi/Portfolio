        Hello, I'm Dora. I've always been passionate about IT and have helped
        those around me with their PC-related issues. <br />
        After several years without my own computer, I purchased one and began
        programming mods and games with friends. <br />I enjoyed it so much that
        I decided to pursue it as a career. <br />What I appreciate most about
        programming is the constant opportunity to learn and the challenges that
        come with finding and fixing errors. <br />The feeling of having
        accomplished something motivates me to keep going. Let's work together
        to create something extraordinary!
